### Subatomic particles
Each atom is made up of an assortment of the following: protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons are packed tightly in the middle (the nucleus) and electrons surround this centre. 
###### Charges
Protons carry a positive electrical charge, neutrons carry a neutral charge, and electrons carry a negative charge. Generally, an atom (or element) will possess an equal amount of protons and electrons, and since positive and negative charges attract each other like magnets, this force the atom together (like gravity). Electrons closest to the nucleus are held in place stronger than outer electrons.

### Conductors and insulators
Materials like copper, silver, and aluminium are electrical conductors as they contain loosely bound outer electrons. Copper is a good example of this, as it has a single loose electron in the outer bounds of its electron cloud:

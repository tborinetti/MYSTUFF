### Subatomic particles
Each atom is made up of an assortment of the following: protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons and neutrons are packed tightly in the middle (the nucleus) and electrons surround this centre. 
###### Charges
Protons carry a positive electrical charge, neutrons carry a neutral charge, and electrons carry a negative charge. Generally, an atom (or element) will possess an equal amount of protons and electrons, and since positive and negative charges attract each other like magnets, this force the atom together (like gravity). Electrons closest to the nucleus are held in place stronger than outer electrons.

### Conductors and insulators
Materials like copper, silver, and aluminium are electrical conductors as they contain loosely bound outer electrons. Copper is a good example of this, as it has a single loose electron in the outer bounds of its electron cloud:

Materials with electrons close to the nucleus are classified as insulators, examples include air, glass, plastic, and rubber. 

For conductors, loosely bound outer electrons can break free, and move atom to atom. These free electrons will drift around aimlessly, but don't move very far or in any particular direction. If these free electrons are given a push in one direction, they will move together in an organized manner. 

### Electrical current
Often called electricity, this describes the displacement of a large number of electrons in the same direction through a conductor, when an external force is applied. This external force is known as **voltage**. The flow of electric current appears to happen instantaneously: this is due to each free electron "jumping" from one atom to the next. Each atom loses an electron to a neighbouring atom, and gains an electron from another neighbour - this cascade effect is what we refer to as electric current. 

As each electron displaces the one in front of it on a conductive path, it appears to be moving instantaneously from one end of the conductor to the other. 

The strength of an electrical current is measured by how many charge carriers/electrons pass a fixed point in one second, and is measured in **amperes** or **amps** (**A**). This measure is similar to measuring water flow in litres per minute. A coulomb refers to the magnitude of the charge carried by one amp of current in one second. 

	One ampere: 6.241 x 10^18
	One coulomb: 6.241 x 10^18

A fridge draws around 3-5 amps of current, and a toaster draws around 9 amps. These are more than typically found in electronic circuits, which are normally measured in **milliamps** (**mA**). One milliamp is one one-thousandth of an amp

	1 amp : 1000 milliamps

The force pushing electrons is called **voltage**, measured in **volts**. This can be thought of as electric pressure, similarly to how water pressure pushed water through pipes. The higher a circuit's voltage, the stronger the electric current will flow through the conductor.
